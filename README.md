# Revenue-Growth-Forecasting
## Introduction

Revenue forecasting is a critical task for investment teams engaged in fundamental analysis. Accurate revenue growth predictions allow organizations to make informed investment decisions, optimize resources, and enhance profitability. This project aims to construct a linear model that forecasts quarterly revenue growth for firms in a given industry using economic and financial indicators.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of 15,000 observations, where each observation includes:
Features (X.npy****): A 4,000-dimensional vector containing economic and financial indicators presumed to influence revenue growth.
Labels (y.npy****): A single value representing the corresponding revenue growth for each observation.


## Objective

To build a linear regression model that minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted and actual revenue growth values on a test dataset. The evaluation set is derived from the same distribution as the training set, ensuring consistency in performance assessment.

## Methodology

1. Data Loading
Load the .npy files containing feature (X) and label (y) data.

2. Data Preprocessing
Normalize the feature set to ensure consistent scaling and improved model performance.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

3. Model Training
Implement a linear regression model using industry-standard libraries like Python's scikit-learn.
Train the model using the training set while tuning hyperparameters using the validation set.

4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using MSE as the primary metric.
Analyze results on the test set to validate predictive accuracy.

5. Optimization
Explore techniques such as feature selection or regularization (e.g., Lasso, Ridge) to enhance model performance.

## Results
The linear regression model's performance is evaluated based on:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
Insights: Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations are generated after running the model.

## Future Improvements
Feature Selection: Identify and retain the most influential predictors from the 4,000-dimensional dataset.

Regularization: Implement techniques like Lasso or Ridge regression to reduce overfitting.

Non-Linear Models: Experiment with advanced models such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks to capture non-linear relationships.

Ensemble Methods: Combine multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness.
